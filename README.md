# AI RPG Generator
 Python app to create an AI prompt useful for creating an RPG game on the fly!

The premise of this project is to use information in tables to generate a sequence that outputs an AI prompt. This prompt should then be able to be used in any major AI capable of writing and imagination.

You will need Python and Pip installed on your computer, along with TKinter
```
pip install tkinter
```
Then, simply run the program. When you click on Generate, it will output a small wall of text that you can copy and paste into your favorite AI (I've tested this on Gemini, ChatGPT, and CoPilot, and all of those work fabulously with this prompt).
